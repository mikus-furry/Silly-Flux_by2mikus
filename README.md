# Silly Flux + LoRA on Colab by:: mikus

## How to Use LoRA:

1. Go to the "LoRA and Flux Models âœ¨" category.
2. Use the repository name and LoRA name to add the model.

### Example:

```text
https://huggingface.co/camenduru/FLUX.1-dev/blob/main/flux_realism_lora.safetensors
```

## In this example:
- `camenduru/FLUX.1-dev` is the repository name.
- `flux_realism_lora` is the LoRA name.

## Notes:
- Currently, LoRA can only be downloaded from Google Drive or Hugging Face. Civitai support is not available yet (I honestly tried to make it work, please don't bite me).
- You can only use one LoRA at a time.
